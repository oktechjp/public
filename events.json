However recently, with ES modules, many are considering https may be succeeding it. Martin will look into the pros/cons and an alternate future. 🤓</p> <p>After the event, we will be heading out for drinks, to chat some more in the moonlight.</p> <p>This time JavaScript happens to be the focus of the meetup but we love to hear about the things you are interested in. Let us know if you have any topic that you would like to talk about or hear about!</p> <p>We hope to see you at the event. 👋</p> ",

I was a front-end developer at the time and we didn't have a back-ender to help us out.

I figured it would be best to... *(to be continued)*</p> <p>Intrigued? 😉 Awesome!</p> <p>Besides a story, please bring a mat to sit on and your own food and drinks.

And writing code that other people could read and understand became more and more essential skill as the projects grew larger and more people began working on it.*</p> <p>*But because it is a skill, you need to train it consciously. It's a lot like writing essays and books. Almost everyone can write letters and words, and many people can also connect them in grammatically correct sentences, but just writing grammatically correct sentences is not enough to make them pleasant and easy to read.*</p> <p>*An essential part of learning writing skills is reading and analyzing other people's code on the one hand and making other people read your code and give you feedback about it.*</p> <p>*I will talk about different methods to make programmers better writers and how to train in the skill of writing code that other people would want to read.*</p> ",

        "description": "<p>Hello Friends, 👋</p> <p>We are in the last stretch before springs arrives proper! After a refresher on old topics in February, we will focus on the opposite perspective this month.</p> <p>Two young*er* members of the meetup will go into the basics. **Jake** will be talking about how *\"**Programming from a Beginner's Perspective**\"* looks like. A perspective much needed for people that try to teach programming or want to make it easier for young ones to enter.</p> <p>After that, **Miguel** will be giving us an introduction to the *\"**Cloud Foundations**\"*, discussing the types of cloud service models, as well as sharing some tips on where to get started.</p> <p>We are looking forward to meet you again this month!</p> <p>If you are interested in contributing or joining us in broader conversations, please join [<a href=\"https://owddm.com/discord](https://owddm.com/discord\" class=\"linkified\">https://owddm.com/discord](https://owddm.com/discord</a>).</p> <p>We are also in the process of preparing next months event! If you have something you want to present please share it in the **[#presentation](<a href=\"https://discord.gg/tb5CZXen)**-proposal\" class=\"linkified\">https://discord.gg/tb5CZXen)**-proposal</a> channel or [send in a presenter proposal](<a href=\"https://discord.gg/tb5CZXen\" class=\"linkified\">https://discord.gg/tb5CZXen</a>).</p> <p>You can also help us shape OWDDM by filling out [our survey](<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzo6DecghqIfir5O-2eiuQXPf81j97XcOCVEr6eJgUSEGeMw/viewform\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzo6DecghqIfir5O-2eiuQXPf81j97XcOCVEr6eJgUSEGeMw/viewform</a>).</p> <p>Cheers!</p> ",
