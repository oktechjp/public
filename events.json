In our meetups we often have presentations by our members on topic which are of their interest:\n\nWordpress Plugin? *Cool thing.* Secret for AWS! *Certainly.* Usability of japanese websites? *Yes, please.* Typography for Accessibility? *Nice.* Latest GraphQL framework? *Definitely.*\n\nWe want to organize events with presentations and we welcome anyone to join and present their projects, ideas or new things they learned at the meetup. This meetup could be your opportunity to practice your presentation skills and/or find like-minded friends to exchange about life as web *(semi-?)* 😉 professional.\n\nRecently, more and more members from Kyoto have a hard time joining us, which is why we recently set up the [KWDDM](https://www.meetup.com/kyoto-web-developers-and-designers-meetup) which, same like this here, is organized by volunteers.

We will start at noon and in the evening have a set of presentations before we go out for drinks. It is okay to join us later (say around 17:00) for presentation round-ups. You can hack together or alone. If you are looking for others to join you it would be nice if you could share your interest in the comments so maybe others can join you.\n\nWe meet this month again at the Aiming office. They have been so kind to offer their shiny, new office in the new Tower B.\n\nLooking forward to next week!",

          "description": "Dear Web enthusiasts and developers,\n\nWelcome back for our November Meetup, probably our last regular meetup scheduled for this year. This month we couldn’t arrange the event at our usual place kindly provided to us by Aiming, but we were able to secure a room at Synergy Marketing (https://www.synergy-marketing.co.jp/company/en/location/). It’s a bit harder to access but it’s one of the few places that can accommodate us all.\n\nAnyway, changing our venue is worth the hassle because one of our speakers this month is Koji Kimura-san from Button Inc (http://btn-inc.jp/about/). He will be talking about Designing off-screen interaction.\n\nUpdated: Another reason why you should attend this meetup is our second speaker, Jeremiah Chienda, who will be talking about Functional programming. He will help demystify the newcomers who don't know what to make of it and will spark a good discussion with the veterans of this programming paradigm that is becoming mainstream.\n\nDid we manage to capture your interest? We hope to see you on November 26 at Synergy Marketing. Please note that we will start at 7PM this time, one hour later than usual. Here is how to get there (https://www.google.com/maps/dir/34.7036282,135.4977071/Japan,+%E3%80%92530-0003+%C5%8Csaka-fu,+%C5%8Csaka-shi,+Kita-ku,+D%C5%8Djima,+1+Chome%E2%88%926%E2%88%9220,+%E5%A0%82%E5%B3%B6%E3%82%A2%E3%83%90%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B6/@34.7000861,135.4928541,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x6000e6f2706da48f:0xb88c3a6d57083f1c!2m2!1d135.4963967!2d34.6969038!3e2?hl=en) from Umeda train station. I am told that the meeting space is inside a building that is really hard to miss; you know you have arrived at the right place if you can see a book shop at the 1st floor. Inside the building there is only one central elevator that will take you up to the 21st floor (you will find us there).\n\nAs usual, after the meetup we will go out to a near-by Izakaya for drinks and post-meetup socializing. If you know any good places to eat/ drink around that area please let us know and we will make a reservation. It might spare the effort of going back to Umeda, at our regular drinking spot.\n\nSee you soon,",

For those of you who won't be escaping the summer heat at end of the month, we have the opportunity to meet again on August 26 at 6PM, at Aiming Inc.’s Osaka Studio.\n\nAfter a short self-introductory session, Daniel (https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielojedaloisel/) (a Spanish developer who recently joined our group) will introduce us to the concept of Extreme Programming. As he defines it, “extreme programming is a software development methodology, a set of practices to achieve its 5 core values. It focuses on lowering the cost of change which is mainly related with the maintenance cost of the software products. Beware! Some of its practices are dangerously addictive, at least for me.”\n\nMatthew Badeau (whom you already well know from previous meetups) will continue the chatbot discussion with a talk about the chatbot he made to collect temperatures from around his office. Last month we saw the UI/UX perspective and this month we are going to see what toolkit to use and how it can be used for internal company projects.\n\nAfter the meetup, we usually go to a nearby Izakaya for some drinks and some more relaxing chat.\n\nLooking forward to see you on August 26 at 6PM.

It’s a bit off-center, but you will find your travel to be rewarded with a kind, kid-friendly(!) cafe-atmosphere. 😻\n\nOn the 28th of May, we will have two presentations.\n\nIn his very accessible presentation, Jun will be looking in *\"First steps with TypeScript\"* on how to get started using TypeScript for websites. 🚀\n\nMartin will then be talking about how the NPM registry has become pretty much standard for JavaScript dependencies. However recently, with ES modules, many are considering https may be succeeding it. Martin will look into the pros/cons and an alternate future. 🤓\n\nAfter the event, we will be heading out for drinks, to chat some more in the moonlight.\n\nThis time JavaScript happens to be the focus of the meetup but we love to hear about the things you are interested in.

I figured it would be best to... *(to be continued)*\n\nIntrigued? 😉 Awesome!\n\nBesides a story, please bring a mat to sit on and your own food and drinks.

Not about a particular piece of code but about ***\"writing code that other people like to read\"***. Since Evil Martians maintains a lot of OpenSource projects, he will surely be able to share a lot of insight. *(whole description at the end)*\n\nAlso, James is going to continue his **collaborative** **live-coding session** from last time and work on the new OWDDM webpage - designed by Kimmy.\n\nAnd there is still space/time for another presentation.

And writing code that other people could read and understand became more and more essential skill as the projects grew larger and more people began working on it.*\n\n*But because it is a skill, you need to train it consciously. It's a lot like writing essays and books. Almost everyone can write letters and words, and many people can also connect them in grammatically correct sentences, but just writing grammatically correct sentences is not enough to make them pleasant and easy to read.*\n\n*An essential part of learning writing skills is reading and analyzing other people's code on the one hand and making other people read your code and give you feedback about it.*\n\n*I will talk about different methods to make programmers better writers and how to train in the skill of writing code that other people would want to read.*",

Presentation: Martin is planning to have his next entry on the topic of Logins\\. This time he will look into Logins for Businesses\\.\n***Features of a modern Login System*** 🔐 based on AWS Cognito. Answering the question of what it does and why. Al while keeping in mind what effort it might take to implement them. 🥸\n\n2\\. Presentation: Gregory will talk about '** Buying/Renting in Japan with a bit of Neumorphism**'.\nIn this brief presentation, we explore the age old question. Is it better to buy or rent a home (Japan Edition)? Join and help me as we go through a simple Svelte app I made as a fun little project to help folks answer this pervasive yet elusive question. On the way, we also discuss some elements of Neumorphic design, what it's like using it and whether you should use it.\n\nFor now we have two presentations this month, so if you want to try out a presentation for the next events please contact us. → [Presentation Proposal](https://forms.gle/KifJzLSmcXUPxSFk7)\n\nWe are looking forward to meeting you!\n\nPS.: We are still in the process of publishing the results, but we'd are actively looking at your feedback → [Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/bVN8vrMrBCNkqpcd9)",

Now that we are in Spring we have a meetup for you. 🌱\n\nThis month first-time OWDDM presenter Sammy will be talking about the relationship between users and platforms with **[Nostr](https://nostr.com/)**. Nostr is a new messaging system between users - an SNS. We can be looking forward to an overview of why it exists, how you can use it, and the possibilities of what can be built with it.\n\nThe second presentation is going to be as relevant as it is going to be conceptual. Martin noticed that many people have trouble identifying **what a designer does** and is going shine a light on it from the perspective of a developer. This topic may seem obvious but in face of Code and image generation through AI - in a time where No-Code is a hot topic and Apps can be built by single persons we may need to re-think what a \"**designer**\" does as a profession.\n\n* RSVP to join us ➡\n\nThe presentation idea comes from our Discord group.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nWe also have a special meeting this month by TAMAS PIROS.\n**[Check out](https://www.meetup.com/osaka-web-designers-and-developers-meetup/events/292146517/)**[ ](https://www.meetup.com/osaka-web-designers-and-developers-meetup/events/292146517/)the detail and join this workshop.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nJoin our [DisCord Channel ](https://discord.gg/D4XaVAyQ)to share your ideas.",

In his presentation on the \"**State of Rust for Web Development\",** we will get a glimpse on how it is to use Rust (the programming language) both for the Frontend, the Backend and other stuff in between.\n\nAfter that, *Andrey* will be introducing us to [Imgproxy](https://github.com/imgproxy/imgproxy) and share with us how to **handle user-uploaded images with ease and confidence**. There are a lot of things to do with user images such as create previews *(or thumbnails)* of different sizes, add watermarks, crop to aspect ratio and so on and so forth. Andrey will look at what the challenges are and how imgproxy solves them.\n\nWe are looking forward to see you. 😍\n\nIn case you wonder how we are choosing the topics for the meetups: We have a presentation [proposal form](https://forms.gle/KifJzLSmcXUPxSFk7) and a channel in our discord group that we use. If there is something you wish to talk about or hope to hear something about, join us [on discord](https://owddm.com/discord) and let us know, so we can organize the meetups together.",

How do budgets control the obsolescence in the digital world?\nIn **\"(un)planned obsolescence\"** *Martin* would like to invite to explore new perspectives in project planning, feature creep and power. With a focus on the web, he will introduce this further concepts, not limited to the physical world.\n\nIn their first time presentation, *Destiny* will be presenting about **\"Digital Marketing Strategies\"**. Sharing lessons learned and how we can combine it with Web development.\n\nAnd in a rare third presentation for the month we are happy to have Eduardo Gonzalez will be talking about large language models. In **\"Obsoleting OpenAI with local models for agents\"** we will be getting insight in new ways to deal with LLM's that might have the power to make a lot of current effort seem like old things rather quickly.\n\nWe are also planning our November Meetup which will likely be JavaScript-focused.

That's a question?\"***\n\nVim is a terminal only text editor that can be challenging to use on the first try. With Greg's help we will figure out why it is still relevant and why we may want to learn it. Be prepared you might not be able to exit. *(More in the [discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1110872279845457920))*\n\nIn our second talk, Akina and Martin will be tackling the topic of ***\"Signal to Noise ratio\"***. In this prescient topic, they will be looking practical impacts of content generation (AI). Martin will be introducing theoretical framework and show how terms and solutions of classic signal processing could maybe proof useful when talking about the current challenges with AI. Akina will then look at the practical Marketing with AI in mind. How will the tools change? What new things do we need to consider?

Join us for a chill Saturday evening talking about working with other people.\n\nFor this event we have the always great [Chad Kohalyk ](https://chadkohalyk.com/) give us a crash course in cross cultural teams:\n\nCommunication is the lifeblood of an organization. As an international in Japan, it is highly likely you are working in Not only a multilingual but a cross-cultural work environment. You may be in a local office with Japanese coworkers, or working remotely with development teams overseas, or managing multi-timezone teams within a giant multinational.\n\nWe will get a short overview of Erin Meyer’s excellent book *[The Culture Map: Breaking Through the Invisible Boundaries of Global Business](https://erinmeyer.com/books/the-culture-map/)* which lays out an 8-scale framework for analyzing business culture and developing strategies for an effective team. We will dig into a couple of key factors so that you can go to work the next day with some new perspective and even some tips.\n\nThis in an **interactive session**. Come prepared to contribute as we will ask everyone to sit in groups that *maximize diversity* of country and culture. You will get the opportunity to work through each of the scales in small groups. All you need to bring are: your own experiences as a cross-cultural person; an open mind; and a pen/pencil.\n\n*NOTE*: Although we will be discussing research on different cultural contexts, we will handle this topic with sensitivity. The point is **not** putting people in boxes, but to appreciate the different ways people can operate across a spectrum relative to you, and to one another other.\n\n([Link to the discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1208601800622608394))",

S3 is one of the most important services of AWS. It offers a simple way to store files and it has changed the hosting world in the past 15 years and turned AWS into the hosting juggernaut that it is today. Martin had some sleepless nights with S3 in the last month. Join the workshop to learn how to not freak out when you use S3 for work or fun. Bring your notebook to try it out by yourself. *(By the way: did you know that S3 is useful even outside of AWS?)* [→ [Link on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1034792577293094972/1249232144664891434)] [ → [Preparation Instructions](https://gist.github.com/martinheidegger/a815a8b3cc1d655f482320387d8a8214) ]\n\nDepending on the mood on the day, we can try out more things or have a networking session after the workshop.\n\n*If you are financially in a tight spot, please contact us at [mail@owddm.com](mailto:mail@owddm.com)*\n*and we can surely figure something out.*\n\nLooking forward to seeing you!\n\n[ [About OWDDM](https://owddm.com/about) ]",

To prepare for this, Martin would like to explore the hiking routes up to the [Gyokuzo Temple](https://gyokuzo.com/en/). From the west, six possible routes make sense up the mountain.\n\n\\- A: Starting from [Hattorigawa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/71sHYgrL3MTVQCKX6) station, the most cultural route passes by the [Yao Museum of History and Folklore](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mYRWnhor33PAxZSBA) and a few other cultural relics and on the route passes [Mizunomijizoin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BypmGSzGSpjvfuC37) which seems to have a gorgeous view. This route is also quite long and reaches the Temple from the north.\n\\- B: The easiest and obvious route would be from [Shigisan-guchi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xFzt5H2BrYjYHRfXA) station or - using the Cable-car - [Takasuyama](https://maps.app.goo.gl/toUJ9NoXZAPmLskH9) Station. Direct would be super-short and skip the mountain ascension.\n\\- C: The easiest by train but also the longest starts at [JR Kashiwara](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CNTTJMaonGZJw3eo7) station. It passes by the seemingly quite beautiful, [Nudehiko Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W1EZsLh9JxP6ZHjS6) and a big power station.\n\\- D: The fourth route passes starts from [Onji station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JEANPH7CfgG9wsCM8), passes the [Chakichian culture house](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WB51FmDmfzubUav57) (with a nice cafe) and the [Onji Shrine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GgaCP95Anzd6Wu268) \\- which looks lovely \\- before winding up the hill\\, a medium length route it seems\\.\n\\- E: From the south\\, taking the unconventional [Kawachi-Katakami](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2F4S2vgkeDEVxSKE7) Station, it is possible to stop by the very interesting looking [Landslide Infrastructure Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g56XyvHchntpP9Pq7) (they have free guided tours), before taking a relatively relaxed but longer route, passing a few lesser known shrines.\n\\- F: \\(Specially interesting in April\\) the Route starting from [Shigisan-shita](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ivadXAnKycQkDURq8) and passing by a famous, steep [road with a thousand cherry trees](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Bmo6Ch84z72N6McVA) might be the most touristic one. Martin went there before, its nice but also a bit underwhelming.\n\nAnyways, this time the plan is to use route A+B. Having a look at the museum before hiking up the mountain and having a look at the main temple before tracking back to the the cable car station and heading down to the west.\n\n8:45 Meeting at [Hattorigawa Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N5A5MTgfniAE3P8H8)\n9:00 Enter [Yao Museum of History and Folklore](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EBwgSMkFHps1wXSG7)\n10:00 Meeting outside the Museum for those who want to skip it.\n11:45 Bento Lunch at [Mizunomijizoin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BUDcxBfv92MRsXvf7) \\- \\(Bring it with you\\!\\)\n14:00 Heading to [Benzaiten Falls](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3quqykyUM6YhvQxr5)\n14:20 Arrival at the [Chogosonshi-ji](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NEghQK9EyTotDEA17) entrance *(hop-on point for people who want to take a different route)*\n15:30 Finish visiting of the Temple area.\n17:05 Last cable car down\n\nThis is the plan for now, lets talk more on [→ Discord](https://owddm.com/discord) in the *#meet-irl* channel.",

We organized a Machiya meeting room to have our meetup in. Let's see how that style works.\n\n*Also: You are not having a Deja'vu 🐈‍⬛ !* This is the [same event plan](https://www.meetup.com/osaka-web-designers-and-developers-meetup/events/288595894) as we are having in Osaka. Both Kimmy and Jacob would like to practice their presentation twice and since they are both okay with it, we thought to give it a try.\n\nFor November we have already a little planned, but if you feel like sharing your knowledge then feel free to [propose a presentation](https://forms.gle/umcRKdEy9SekLQL68)! 📥\n\nFeedback has been trickling in and we are looking into a way to share it with everyone.

Nota)* will be hosting us and we will be looking to find snacks right there.\n\n*(Update: Jake has initially been scheduled to present on React and the DOM but he has been covered with work this week and will need to hold it at another time.)*\n\nIn our presentation of the day, Martin will take a look at \"**TypeScript Tips and Tricks for React\"**. In it he will attempt to share how he uses TypeScript with React and how he notices that it can be difficult to use TypeScript. Maybe you can catch some new and old reasons on what power to get from using TypeScript.\n\nAfter that we will be having two discussions. The first will be by **Parama** who will be hosting a round table on the topic of **Relational Databases or Not** in which she would like to figure out with us what we think is better and why.\n\nAnd... we have a second discussion this Saturday! Sacha will be reflecting a little bit about things **he learned in the past**. Things that are outdated by now, and that he will probably not use again. In a conversation he would like to explore how knowledge becomes less important over time and what we can treat as experience.\n\nThis is going to be a full evening and we hope to see you there! If you can't make it this time, [join the Discord](https://owddm.com/discord) to figure out when the next one is and maybe share if you feel like presenting something yourself.\n\n*Photos: Volunteers are usually taking photos at the events for ourselves and to be presented at our homepage. If you find a photo of yourself on our homepage that you have a problem with, please let us know through GitHub or at the event itself, thanks.*",

Let's learn how the [Cursor AI-native IDE](https://www.cursor.com/) can be used to save time writing code. The IDE can help us be faster writing simple web apps with LLMs. The talk will also cover using LLM APIs for building a simple web app with web scraping, custom prompts, and formatted responses.\n\nIf you have another topic you would like to talk about, please submit a #presentation-proposal in the [Discord](https://owddm.com/discord).\n\nTo join the event, a basic knowledge of web programming will be useful. Also, it would be good to bring your notebook if you want to try it out by yourself.",

          "description": "Hello Friends,\n\nGetting out at the weekend and talk over tech while on a hike can be a nice balance between learning new things and moving one's body. Also, In hot Kyoto its nice to get out as we recently figured out when we went to [Ishiyamadera](https://www.meetup.com/kyoto-web-designers-and-developers-meetup/events/302842348/).\n\nIn this extra-curricular event [Sacha](https://sachagreif.com/) is guiding us through Kyoto's mountains along the Kiyotaki river.\n\n9:32 Meet at [JR Hozukyo Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nbDJYZD5nUHVEm9n9)\n\\~11:00 Pass the [Atago Torii Gate](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Dxb933ZpopJtn6Jm8) in Kiyotaki Village\n\\~12:30 Visit the [Kuya Waterfall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/G9YkJjtxryiaX96i7)\n\\~16:00 Visit [Saimyo temple](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KsDUTLFNJwPLahUa7) (optional, visit the main hall for 500yen)\n\\~16:30 Return via [Takao Bus Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CJmjpmEuPGVs6n8X6) to Kyoto Center\n\n**Note**: there is a bus going back from Kiyotaki Village to Arashiyama, so it's possible to **just do the first half** of the hike.\n\nPlease bring lunch and enough to drink. There may also be mosquitos and hot sun at the day. Also, if you want to head for a swim (there are multiple beautiful swimming spots along the river): swimwear and a towel might be a good idea.\n\n*Note:* Children welcome since the path is almost entirely flat and easy to walk, but it's a longer hike. It would be good if they are used to it.",

Now we can have a [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/) or other security devices to be used for 2FA and to iron our security. In this two part session we will first look at the possibilities and difficulties that come up when using security and then try out keys together. It would be awesome if you could bring your own, but we will have a few to try out at the event.\n\nWe are happy to be hosted at [C2 Kyoto](https://c2kyoto.com/) once more! To support the venue the C2 is offering drinks. Please do not bring outside food or drinks. Thank you. Drink sales help us to support the event.
